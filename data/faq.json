    "ANSWER": "Exactly… riches and glory beyond your wildest dreams, IF you play admirably. Heroes will be able to claim WRLD token, and Artifacts based on their in-game performance, playtime, and a few other (surprise) metrics, on a daily basis. The better your in-game performance, the rarer the Artifacts you’ll be dropped. Win enough, and you’ll be immortalized in the Hall of Heroes. Hero Galaxy Battle Planets will also host multiple live, timebound, in-game competitions, whose winners will receive grand prizes (riches and glory)."
  },
  {
    "QUESTION": "Artifacts?",
    "ANSWER": "Artifacts are badges of honor, won on the battlefield. Each Artifact earned by your Hero in-game is a standalone NFT, that can be equipped by your Hero within the Armory, thereby increasing its rarity."

All Battle Planets present unique opportunities to prove your honor, and increase the value of your Hero. Your Hero’s performance in the Battle Planet will be immortalized on the blockchain such that everyone and their gods might watch over your illustrious victories, and epic defeats.     "

    "QUESTION": "Won’t Mojang sue you?",
    "ANSWER": "No, for the same reason they don’t sue NFT Worlds – only open-source content is being leveraged to create this game. We’re a web3 overlay for Minecraft, trying to funnel players into Minecraft and let them earn money by playing.    "

  {
    "QUESTION": "What kinds of Battle Planets will there be? When DAO? How will rewards be distributed? ",
